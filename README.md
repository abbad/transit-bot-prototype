# transit-prototype


This is a prototype demonstrating integrating slack and mta libs to show if there is a delay on the subway system. There is no Lambda and Lex integration in this one. I have used Node since I wanted  to learn a new language. For the aws lambda part, please check https://github.com/abbad/transit-bot-lambdas
